Hi, my name is Jack Bischoff.

I graduated from University of Maryland, College Park with a degree in Computer Science and an English concentration.
During my college studies, I interned at [Greymatter.io](https://greymatter.io) during summers and winter breaks. During that time, I worked across many projects.
Now, I work there full time as a web engineer.

My work at Grey Matter revolves around their solutions projects and involves many hats including developing React apps, microservice APIs, technical writing, site reliability engineering, and project design. I've done a lot.

If you for some reason care, I value or believe in:

- creativity
- innovation
- precision
- integrity
- design-thinking
- liberty
- reason
- conviction
- honor
