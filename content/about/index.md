Hi, my name is Jack Bischoff.

I graduated from University of Maryland, College Park with a degree in Computer Science and an English concentration.
During my college studies, I interned at [Greymatter.io](https://greymatter.io) during summers and winter breaks. During that time, I performed a variety of tasks.
Now, I work there full time as a web developer.

Professionally, I value creativity, innovation, precision, psychological safety, and design-thinking.

Personally, I value integrity, liberty, reason, dedication to quality, truth-seeking, passion, honor, and made in USA Brooks Brothers Oxford cloth button downs.

My work at Grey Matter revolves around their solutions projects and involves many hats including developing React apps, microservice APIs, technical writing, site reliability engineering, and project design. I've done a lot.
